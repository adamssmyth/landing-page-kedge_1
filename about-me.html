                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>Hello! I’m Adam Smyth, a passionate and dedicated Marketing Executive currently specializing in International Marketing with a focus on Luxury Management at KEDGE Business School. With a foundation in Communications and International Relations from University College Dublin, my academic and professional journeys have equipped me with a rich blend of knowledge and skills ideal for a dynamic marketing landscape.</p>

                <p>My experience spans various facets of marketing and communications, from managing and optimizing social media content for multiple brands to enhancing website performance and user engagement through targeted SEO strategies. At Mias Pharma and Press Up Hospitality Group, I led significant projects that not only increased digital footprint but also deepened consumer connections.</p>

                <p>As a lifelong learner, I have continually updated my technical skills, achieving certifications in Google Analytics, Photoshop, and Excel, and am currently enhancing my programming skills through a Full Stack Web Development course at Le Wagon.</p>

                <p>Beyond marketing, I’m a globe-trotter with a penchant for arts, fashion, and culture, always eager to bring a creative and thoughtful perspective to my work. Whether running on the trails or exploring new films, I believe in staying balanced and inspired.</p>

                <p>I invite you to explore my CV and some past work, where I showcase my journey, the challenges I've embraced, and the creativity I bring to my professional endeavors. Let’s connect and explore how we can collaborate on future projects!</p>
